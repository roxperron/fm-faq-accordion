### What I learned


This is the first time Iâ€™ve coded something new since finishing my academic program, so this project has been a real exercise in memory and revision. I encountered a CSS bug related to a selector rule, which helped me better understand the effects of cascading in stylesheets.

While working on the JavaScript, I had difficulties with using `querySelector` vs `querySelectorAll`. However, by doing some research, I found an article on freeCodeCamp that helped me debug my code.

This project also allowed me to review the principles of semantic HTML and CSS properties. I tried to apply the BEM naming convention for my classes to make my code more structured and maintainable.


### Useful resources

- [Accordion menu by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript/) 


This helped me better understand how `querySelectorAll` works and also assisted me in refactoring my CSS to be more accurate.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
